# About my project:

DB Tech Support is a site designed to help users fix their devices or find a place to take them where they can feel satisfied with the results. In the app, you’ll be able to request a quote. Quotes are carefully calculated based on the price of the product and the amount of time our staff takes to fix the device. You can also book appointments at any of our approved on-site tech supports, we carefully evaluate and hand-pick the places we refer our clients. Our top priority is to make sure our clients are comfortable trusting us with their devices.  Furthermore, in the app you’ll be able to find a solution to fix yourself, we have listed the three main options Phones, Computers and iPads. You will be able to see and select from a long list of possible solutions to fix your devices. Once you are able to identify the issue and see that the option is listed on our site, you can select it and you’ll be able to see a very detailed step-by-step process on how to fix your devices along with a list of tools and pieces you will need to successfully complete the process. 

In addition, the user is able to find the closest store, find a tool needed to repair their device and find the piece. Other features include a long list of frequently asked questions so the user can easily find what they are looking for without having to wait for us to reply. Finally, both users and admins are able to create accounts to manage their current orders or to place new ones. This will help as their information will be automatically filled in by the system.
